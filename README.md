# Parking website

This is the UI portion of an application designed to allocate parking spaces.

The main part of the application lives in the repository [here](https://github.com/paulbulman/Parking).

## Getting started

If you clone the repo, and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), you should be able to execute `npm i` from the project directory to install the necessary dependencies, and then `npm start` to run a local copy of the website. This includes various mock API implementations using [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

Log in using username `user@example` and password `pass`. (Or `teamLeader@example`:`pass`, or `userAdmin@example`:`pass`, to access other parts of the UI.)

There are some unit tests that can be run using `npm t`, and integration tests using `npm run cypress`.
